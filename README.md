# IDENTIFYING-DRIVERS-LOCALITY-AND-TRANSALATING-DIGITAL-ROAD-SIGN-BOARDS-TO-THEIR-LOCAL-LANGUAGE
Registration numbers are used for identifying the Driverâ€™s locality (i.e in which state the vehicle has registered). Capturing photos of the Number plates of a vehicle using a camera and extracting the registration number will help us in achieving this Identification. 
Once the locality of the driver is identified, we translate all the Road Sign Boards (Digital) to their local language throughout their journey. So that, it will be easy for the Drivers from other states to understand the sign boards in any state.
